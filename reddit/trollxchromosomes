HIFW this fucking bird is chirping outside my window from 1am-5am all this week, driving me crazy.
I have a wide range of very stimulating hobbies. I swear.
I've been miserable at the worst job I've ever had for months. While walking out of a meeting detailing all of the new (negative) changes that are about to be implemented, I got a call with a better-paying job offer with a way better company. MFW.
i started AND finished my shampoo and conditioner at the same time...
MRW I'm getting ready and I sneeze right after applying mascara.
When you roll out of bed and leave the house still wearing last night's winged eyeliner and someone compliments you on your makeup
MRW when my shitty abusive ex sends me his thousandth friend request after deciding that he needs me and can't live without me.
I happened upon this story while looking through the news this morning. I thought maybe some fellow trolls would be interested.
Think about baseball! Golf! Cold showers!!! ANYTHING!!
I found out I'm still young enough to apply for the work/travel visa I wanted! This means less arduous paperwork, and my dream to travel abroad and expand my career is a go!
MFW I forget a tampon and finally get home and see my panties
Any other Russian TrollXers here? Hello? :D
Bae Goals
MRW I realize my dad doesn't want me to come live with him at his house even though he knows I'm miserable at my mom's house.
When your (poorly-done) nail polish matches your pencil. #justgirlythings
Our reaction when our super great/smart/stunningly hot/all around great coworker takes a job at a different location.
MRW I only got 3 hours of sleep but I signed the papers and am now hired for a job that pays more than my last two combined!
MRW my FWB complains when I'm too tired to give him a blow job.
I have nothing. I just wanted you all to have this magnificent catbeard.
HIFW I get home to take the nap that I've been fantasizing about all day
MFW I have crippling social anxiety and just went on the first date (I think?) of my life.
I feel like you guys would appreciate my sister.
So...not anytime soon then?
HIFW I know I need to move on from the ex I'm still in love with, my depression has come back full force, I've been bleeding for the past twenty days with no end in sight, and finals are right around the corner
